# YOLOv8 Object Detection and Deep SORT for Shoes Dataset

## Overview

This repository presents an implementation of object detection using YOLOv8 and object tracking with Deep SORT on a custom dataset focused on shoes. The combination of YOLOv8 for real-time object detection and Deep SORT for tracking enables accurate and robust tracking of shoes in video footage.

## Dataset

- **Shoes Dataset:** The dataset used for training and evaluation focuses specifically on shoes, providing a diverse set of images and video sequences to capture various shoe types, angles, and scenarios.

## Features

- **YOLOv8 Object Detection:** YOLOv8 is employed for real-time object detection, allowing the model to identify and localize shoes in images and video frames.

- **Deep SORT Object Tracking:** The system utilizes Deep SORT for object tracking, providing a framework for associating and tracking detected shoes across multiple frames.
